# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, everyone, my name is Lance Guevarra!
I also use TheSocialZombie, or Zombie, as my online nicknames! In real life, you may also call me Lapis!
## ðŸ”Ž Who am I?
I am an aspiring software engineer and video game designer, studying for my Bachelor's in Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I've also created numerous videos on topics I enjoy, and I sometimes draw, write songs, and stream over on Twitch! I've worked on various video game projects in many different genres! Many of these projects can be found in my repositories!
